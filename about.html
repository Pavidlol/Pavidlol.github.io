		   <h1 class="text-center">My Origins&nbsp;</h1>
          <p>
My gaming journey began in 2011 when I was just 5 or 6 years old when I first started playing games like Madden, Wii Sports, and Super Smash Bros ultimate. I was never really that good at Madden but I always wanted to stay up late and play career mode. I would play on easy mode and get the best states in the game. A year or two later I got Madden 09 which was an older Madden but it had older characters and different modes that I loved.
</p>
		  <h1 class="text-center">The start of the PS4&nbsp;</h1>
		  <p>2 years later I started playing NHL Legacy game. This is all games on an Xbox 360 or Wii but in 2017 I got a PS4. The day I got my PlayStation I downloaded Madden 18 and NHL 18. My friend, dad and I would always play 3v3s on NHL. We tried getting the whole campaign done, but we never did. Now looking back on Madden, I realize that they barely changed the game. And if they did most of the time, I didn’t like it. A few weeks later I downloaded this game called Fortnite. Fortnite is my favorite game of all time. I was obsessed with that game. In 6th grade I would do all nighters with some of my friends. Even nowadays I play all nighters on that game. A few months after I got Fortnite I got Rainbow 6 Siege. I played for a bit and when I got a pc I bought it again, but it was never my main game. When I was 13 or 14 I got Apex Legends the first day it came out. I don’t play that game anymore, but it was ok. I got more games like Rouge Company, Split gate, Call of Duty Warzone, Realms Royale, and Fall Guys. I still play Fall Guys on rare occasions. </p>

			<h1 class="text-center">Getting a PC&nbsp;</h1>
         <p>During 20221 I got a pc. I moved to Allen in 2021 and when I moved, I saved up my money and bought a pc.  I've been playing on pc for over a year now and omg I don't know how I used to play on controller let alone console 2 games that I love. I play mostly Fortnite Among us and Valorant. I play both games to this day. I am Silver 2 in rank Valorant. I’m trying to get better but it's a pretty hard game. Every once in a while, I will join a discord call with randoms and play Among Us and it’s so much fun. That’s where we are at this point and time. I play Fortnite, Among Us, and Valorant. I’m not really the person who looks at upcoming games. So, I don’t have any upcoming games that I want.
